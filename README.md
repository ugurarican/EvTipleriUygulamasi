# EvTipleriUygulamasi
There are 3 home type classes, 1 service class and 1 interface as a house, villa and cottage. I used common methods for house types in interface.
In my Service class
A method that returns the total prices of houses
A method that returns the total prices of villas
The method that returns the total prices of the cottages
Method to return the total price of all types of houses
A method that returns the average square meter of houses
A method that returns the average square meter of villas
The method that returns the average square meter of the cottages
I created the methods of returning the average square meter of houses of all types.
I have printed these methods on the console screen in my main class.
